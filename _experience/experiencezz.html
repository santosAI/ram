            <ul>
                <li>Developed COVID-19 Classifier by analyzing Chest X-Ray images with patient report generation in collab- oration with Niramai Health Analytix. Service currently used by 246 radiologists and doctors.
                </li>
                <li>Optimised training with multiple datasets with parallel training of tasks. Achieved recall of 96% and precision of 80% on test dataset from doctors.
                </li>
                <li>Developed front end web interface using flask and deployed the model. Setting up complete pipelines for automated patient report generation with high reliability as cases (patient Chest X-rays) are time critical.
